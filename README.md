This is a beginners guide to downloading data from NestWatch, filtering it with R, and then plotting it in R. Also included are instructions on how to filter the point data based on a shapefile, and how to load in a raster. 

The shapefile and raster are included in the repo to be used during the project. The NestWatch raw dataset is too large to share, however, instructions are included on how to download directly from NestWatch.
